On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel.
First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to
lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.

Next stop will be china. _A._ will be doing an internship in Beijing
starting in October and I will give her company as long as I'm permitted
to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist
for as long as an intern.

When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our
ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe
some more places where I don't need a complicated visa).

At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back
home together. Or at least that is the plan.

All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking
forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I
mention, we don't really speak any chinese language? 

As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of
this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to
documenting our travels.

Since I'm not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along
the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble
posting to this blog, therefore I've also set up accounts over at
[tumblr](http://mo-gr.tumblr.com) and [posterous](http://mo-gr.posterous.com).
And be sure to also follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mo_gr) if
you want to stay up to date.

We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places
in a semi regular fashion.
