*Disclaimer: This post is mostly a testbed. Since I plan to occasionally blog about my upcoming travels, this is an experiment to see what works and what doesn't when writing about travel in hakyll. Nonetheless, this is aimed to be a quick, and hopefully not too boring writeup of our most recent travel to Scotland.*

# Of sheep, single malt and surreal landscapes


*TLDR:* Scotland is a beautiful country and well worth visiting. End of October is a gamble with the weather but turned out to be a great time. I would recommend spending more time in the north west (and Skye in particular) than we did.

Before we depart on our big [journey](/posts/2017-11-18-journey), we were in need for a quick automn-vacation. A few places were on the list, yet for no paritcular reason Scotland turned out to be the destination for us. This time, we were also not traveling alone, but had some good friends along for the ride.

Flights were cheapest to Glasgow, so the plan quickly emerged to take check out Glasgow, then take a rental car and go on a clock-wise tour around beautiful Scotland. We were aiming for a good mix between hiking and visiting distelleries. Looking back, we might have been a bit too ambitious with driving distances and hiking fell a bit short ocasionally. If you plan to repeat this tour, I would recommend to cut driving a bit shorter and spend more time in less places. But overall, it was a great vacation.

Some random thoughts

### Driving

Driving on the other side turned out to be far less of a problem. It took me about an hour to get used to where in relation to the lines on the road I have to be. Then everything more or less just worked. Its easier when there are other cars around and you can just go with the flow. Whereas while I was completely alone (a frequent thing in the Highlands), I sometimes started off on the wrong side, but quickly recovered.

Also, driving on single track roads is no problem at all. Chances for passing and overtaking are frequent. Just make sure to always stay left in those...

After the map. This is a fairly long text to see how it wraps and works with caption of the image
