*tl;dr:* [Here](https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b) is how I integrated [Flattr] into my octopress blog.

##Flattr##

Over the weekend, I integrated [Flattr] into my blog. [Flattr] is an
online payment system for giving small donations to content creators
over the internet. It is a neat way to _tip_ people on the web. It
slowly gains some traction in Europe and many german content creators have it
integrated into their services. Even some newspapers like the german
[taz] integrate [Flattr] to give users of their online portal an easy
way to voluntarily pay for news articles.

In the USA it is not that common yet. Although pages, like [5by5]
started integrating flattr recently as well.

##Octopress integration##

For the [Octopress] Integration, I basically used a
solution by [Simon Szustkowski](http://blog.simonszu.de) that I found
via google. His solution is very straight forward. He gave a detailed
description of it on his [blog](http://blog.simonszu.de/2012/02/flattr-fur-octopress/) 
(which is in german) and there is also an octopress fork with the
changes included over [here](https://github.com/bascht/octopress/commit/e2591467af488bceb2ed058220865cc5111e4f3e#diff-1).

Following that way, you get a [Flattr] button on every post. In addition to that,
I also created a [Flattr] button for the blog as a whole and added it to
the asides. My changes to [Octopress] can be seen 
[here](https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b). 
They integrate Simons solution and my Button for the blog into one
commit to my blog repo.
The [Flattr] Thing for the blog must be created manually on the [Flattr] homepage 
and the URL to that thing must be put in your `_config.yml` under
`flattr_blog_thing`. If that configuration is set and the custom aside
is enabled in the `default_asides`, there will be a [Flattr] Button in
the aside.

{% gist 2106894 %}

All other changes are directly from Simons solution. when the
`flattr_user` is set in `_config.yml`, the flattr-api Javascript will be
included in the header `source/_include/custom/head.html`. This will
also conditionally include `flattr_button.html` in the sharing area below each
post `source/_includes/post/sharing.html`. The [Flattr] Things are
automatically generated by the [Flattr] API when someone first clicks on
one of those buttons. (A _Thing_ in Flattr-Lingo is something you can
give money to.)

##Official support?##

By the way, the currently [official stance](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/255#issuecomment-2566028) of [Octopress] is to not
integrate [Flattr] into the core of [Octopress]. [Brandon](https://github.com/imathis) wants to keep [Octopress]
lean and have only the essentials in the core - which I think is very
reasonable. Maybe there will be an official Flattr-pluign sometime in
the future. Until then, I hope this helps other people integrating [Flattr] into their
[Octopress] setups. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact]
me.

And if you havn't yet tried [Flattr], go ahead and make the internet a
better place for everyone!
