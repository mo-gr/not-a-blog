This morning, we encountered something, I didn't knew existed: _Elevator
Rushhour_. I've never lived in a 28 story building before. We now live
on the 21st floor. If every floor is roughly the same as ours, there are 12
apartments on each floor. 

```
=> (* 28 12)
; 336
```

So there are a good 300 apartments. The building currently has three working elevators. 
Even if we assume that not every
apartment is inhabited and not every inhabitant has to get up in
the morning to get to work, this leaves us with a lot of people that
need to exit the building in a narrow timeframe.

We left at 8:00. And we waited for nearly 10 minutes to finally leave the
building. The elevators were all basically stopping at every other floor
on their way down. Then going all the way up again only to repeat the
stop and go on their way down.
