I did a talk on this years [BED-Con](http://bed-con.org/2015/) about
React.js + Flux (more specifically Redux). I don't think there is a
video of the talk, but my slides are available [here](http://reactflux.notadomain.com/). They are at least partially german, since I 
gave the talk in german. Maybe I'll try to condense it also into a blog
post. But don't hold your breath.
