Only a little over a week left until my full-day AngularJS introduction
workshop and I'm really looking forward to it!

Once again, it shows that the best way to get as deep as possible into a
topic is teaching it. And although I have a firm grasp of AngularJS, 
I have the feeling, there will be
questions, hitting me completely out of the blue. Bring it on!

If you are interested in learning the Basics of AngularJS (and can
handle a German workshop), there are still a few places left.

The workshop will be held during the [Zaunberg Talks](http://zaunberg-talks.de/berlin2013/javascript_angularjs) on the 18th of November in Berlin. [Ping me](http://blog.notadomain.com/about.html#contact) if you want to join!

See you all at [Zaunberg Talks!](http://zaunberg-talks.de/)
