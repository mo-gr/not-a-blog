This years [Berlin Expert Days][bed] conference has come to an end. The [BEDCon][bed] is a small tech conference in, you
guessed it, Berlin. The focus is somewhere around the Java ecosystem but it is no LASER sharp focus.

This years [BEDCon][bed] was full of high quality talks and interesting attendies. The conference sold out with somewhere
around 350 people and although some talks were a bit crowded, the atmosphere was very nice and friendly! Thanks to everyone who
contributed in one way or another! I had a great time.

##Why Coffee is good for developers##

This was the first conference, where I attended as a speaker. I gave a (hopefully) entertaining introduction to [CoffeeScript][cs] on
the second day titled [Why Coffee is good for developers][wcig4d]. And judging by the feedback I got in person and via twitter, the talk was a huge success. Thanks to
everyone who attended! I hope you had as much fun listening as I had giving the talk!

I opened my talk with some facts about actual coffee as a pun on the title of the talk before spinning into
[CoffeeScript][cs] and the problems, it tries to solve. Some people told me, they liked the idea and also enjoyed my
facts about coffee. Although one person aparently didn't liked it at all. He left before I even got to the interesting
parts probably thinking, I was talking about coffee for an hour. Maybe he is more of a tea guy :)

##HTML slides are gaining traction##

My [slides] are available online and the sources are on [github] too (Sorry, slides are in german.) The slides work best in Safari but should also work in Chrome. Non-WebKit Browsers are probably going to have some problems. Since a few people have asked me, I made the
slides with my own custom fork of the fabulous [impress.js]. I rewrote it in [CoffeeScript][cs] and modified it quite a
bit for this presentation. If you plan to use it, at this moment, I have to recomment using [impress.js] over my fork. I
plan to put some more effort into my fork and iron out many of the wrinkles. But at the moment, [impress.js] is more
stable and more active. I'll post here when there are news about my fork.

I was by far not the only speaker with HTML slides. An intersting trend, that I really do appreciate. HTML slides tend
to be less bullet point ridden than powerpoint slides. The presentations are often more interactive and engaging. The slides are easier and faster to
share after the talk and they discourage the stupid idea of printing out slides. But as [impress.js] calls out in its
readme, they "may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)"

One other framework for HTML slides, that looked very intersting was [reveal.js]. [Alexander Reelsen] used it for his
slides and they looked great. But then again, he also hat something interesting to say...

If you have anything to do with the web at all, check out one of the options for HTML slides! Not only is it fun to
create the slides, it is also a nice exercise for your web-fu! And you can use [IntelliJ] instead of PowerPoint for
creating slides - how awesome is that?!
