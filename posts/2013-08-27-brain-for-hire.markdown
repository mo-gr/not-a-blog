I guess it's time to make it official:

### I am now a freelancer

After years of constant employment, this is the first time I
am standing on my own two feet. I'm still on the fence whether this is the
best decision or biggest mistake in my career so far.

I greatly enjoyed working at [akquinet](http://www.spree.de) for the last 
two and a half years. So, the decision to take this step was not an easy
one. But I just have to do this personal experiment. I don't want to
look back at my life later on and regret never having tried this. The
time is right and for the first few months I should be all set.

Nonetheless, here is some shameless self promotion: If you are looking for
an experienced technical consultant to maneuver your JVM based project
out of a tight corner – [contact me]. If you are looking
for an excellent developer to help on your next kick-ass web application – [contact me]. 
If you need someone coaching your team to get up to speed on modern web
technologies – [contact me]. And if you are actually looking for a highly
motivated clojure developer – please, please [contact me].
