On another note, today is actually my last day in Beijing. My next stop will be Seoul and I'm looking forward to it (and to finally having proper Internet again).

However, I'll continue my journey without the mac that I'm currently typing on. I'll only have an iPad with me. Therefore, I can't post any further updates to this blog until we are back home.

Until further notice, all updates will go to either [tumblr](http://mo-gr.tumblr.com), [twitter](http://twitter.com/mo_gr) or [app.net](https://alpha.app.net/mo).

See you on the other side...
