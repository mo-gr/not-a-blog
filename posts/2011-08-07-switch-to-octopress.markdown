After a few weeks of not doing anything to my blog at all I decided to switch to [octopress]. It looks like a nice
project and seems to fit most of my needs. I am currently setting up some form of deployment and tinkering with the
styles. I am currently writing the posts locally and deploy them to an ec2 instance. But I would like to get a setup
running where I can edit and create posts on the go from my iPad. Ideally without ssh-ing into ec2.
