Hi,

my name is Moritz Grauel, or just Mo when you have trouble pronouncing it. I am currently a Software Engineer at [Zalando SE](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/blog/). But you can also hire me for training and short consulting gigs as a free-lancer.

I specialize on web and mobile development. While I don't shy away from
deep-down backend code, I prefer delighting my users with lovingly crafted, modern web
apps brewed from state-of-the-art technologies and seasoned with a good
dose of tasty user experience.

## About this blog

Well obviously the title is a lie. It _is_ a blog. Or at least it is intended to be(come?) one. But since the domain also _is_ a
domain, this is somehow very consistent and teaches you an important lesson about this site: Don't take anything you read here too
serious! Please.

The topics, you are going to read here are wide and diverse but they all have something in common. They interest me to
such a degree, that I felt the urge to write about them. Usually the posts should deal with stuff related to
programming. Probably development. Sometimes tech in general. Or they might have something to do with some of my
hobbies, like [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/27380123@N03/), bouldering, travel... Whatever. 

Needless to say, all views and opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not represent in any way, shape or form the views or opinions of my current or any past employer.

If you don't like what I write, that's fine. Just go away.
The internet is full of stuff. Find something you like.

Stay hungry, stay foolish...
