# Let's hang out and have a farewell beer

Hey friend, coworker or relative,

as you probably know, we will be traveling for half a year soon. We will leave on the 11th of January and - if all goes as planned - won't be back before July.

There won't be a proper farewell party but if you want to say good-bye and have a drink with us, you will find us at [Herman](http://www.bravebelgians.be) on Sunday (January 7th) from around 19:00.

Please don't even think about gifting anything - just come by and have a drink.

And if you don't fancy a drink, why not hang out with us at the bouldering gym [Berta Block](http://bertablock.de). We'll be there from around 15:00. Feel free to join us and have some fun before the drinks.

One way or another, if you want to follow our tracks digitally, here are some good starting points:
